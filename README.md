This is a (mostly) trait object **reference** casting and comparison crate.

There is no registry, instead targets are engraved directly into the `Dyncast` trait implementation by a derive macro.

Concrete types can be targeted too, unsafely through reinterpret casts.  
(This is subject to `#[deny(unsafe)]`. (TODO))

It also does mutability and pin projection, while being economical regarding text sizeâ€¦

> Basically I needed something that's a bit less fancy than the existing solutions,
> and it escalated a bit for there.

Originally developed as part of [`rhizome`](https://crates.io/crates/rhizome) but now separate,
this crate also works very well in combination with [`pinus`](https://crates.io/crates/pinus).
